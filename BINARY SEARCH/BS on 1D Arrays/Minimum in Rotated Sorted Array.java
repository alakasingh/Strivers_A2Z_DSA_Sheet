Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
  Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Now the array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find the minimum element in the array. 

Pre-requisites: Search in Rotated Sorted Array I,  Search in Rotated Sorted Array II & Binary Search algorithm

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
Result: 0
Explanation: Here, the element 0 is the minimum element in the array.

Example 2:
Input Format: arr = [3,4,5,1,2]
Result: 1
Explanation: Here, the element 1 is the minimum element in the array.

public class Solution {
    public static int findMin(int []arr) {
        // Write your code here.
        int low = 0, n=arr.length ,high = n - 1; 
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            //search space is already sorted
            //then arr[low] will always be
            //the minimum in that search space:
            if (arr[low] <= arr[high]) {
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[low]);
                break;
            }

            //if left part is sorted:
            if (arr[low] <= arr[mid]) {
                // keep the minimum:
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[low]);

                // Eliminate left half:
                low = mid + 1;

            } else { //if right part is sorted:

                // keep the minimum:
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[mid]);

                // Eliminate right half:
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
