Find out how many times the array has been rotated
Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Now the array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find how many times the array has been rotated. 

Pre-requisites: Find minimum in Rotated Sorted Array,  Search in Rotated Sorted Array II & Binary Search algorithm

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
Result: 4
Explanation: The original array should be [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 4 times.

Example 2:
Input Format: arr = [3,4,5,1,2]
Result: 3
Explanation: The original array should be [1,2,3,4,5]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 3 times.

        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int index = -1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            //search space is already sorted
            //then arr[low] will always be
            //the minimum in that search space:
            if (arr[low] <= arr[high]) {
                if (arr[low] < ans) {
                    index = low;
                    ans = arr[low];

            if (arr[low] <= arr[mid]) {
                // keep the minimum:
                if (arr[low] < ans) {
                    index = low;
                    ans = arr[low];
                }

                // Eliminate left half:
                low = mid + 1;
            } else { //if right part is sorted:

                // keep the minimum:
                if (arr[mid] < ans) {
                    index = mid;
                    ans = arr[mid];
                }

                // Eliminate right half:
                high = mid - 1;
            }
